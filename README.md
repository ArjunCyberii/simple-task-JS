**Simple Task Application with JavaScript**

## **Project Description**
The **Simple Task Application** is an interactive web-based tool built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to input and display text dynamically. This project showcases two primary functionalities:
1. Displaying text upon a button click.
2. Dynamically updating text in real-time as the user types.

The project features a visually appealing design using CSS, making it both functional and user-friendly.

## **Features**
1. **Dynamic Text Display**:
   - Users can type text in the first input field and click a button to display the entered text in a paragraph below.

2. **Real-Time Text Update**:
   - The second input field updates a paragraph below it in real-time as the user types, providing instant feedback.

3. **Stylish User Interface**:
   - Modern styling with gradients, smooth transitions, and responsive elements ensures an engaging user experience.

## **How It Works**
1. **Button-Triggered Display**:
   - The `sen()` function captures the value of the first input field when the "Click" button is pressed and updates the associated paragraph element.

2. **Real-Time Display**:
   - The `onkeyup` event triggers the `sen1()` function, which dynamically updates the second paragraph element with the current value of the second input field.

- **CSS**: Implements the visual styling, including:
  - Gradients for the background.
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects for the button.
  - Focus effects for input fields.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for capturing and displaying input data.
